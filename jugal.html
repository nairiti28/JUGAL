   <p>I am 5028 Nairiti. I am applying for the position of the academic coordinator of Jugal house for the fiscal year 2078 BS.
       I have tutored as well as helped my peers and juniors on numerous occassions in the field of their academics.
       I have worked tirelessly to maintain the quality of my grades, with occasional trips.
       I have helped in improving the mindset, grades and level of understanding of the ones I tutored.
       They were satisfied with the method of my teaching. I noticed their improvement in the subject through my help.
       I am confident that through my help the students can understand, learn how to apply and even further help others with the topic.

<div id="vision">
    <h5 style="color: rgb(219, 235, 0); font-family: 'Lucida Sans';">My Vision:</h5>
<p>As the academic coordinator, I see myself as an approachable person to others.
    I hope to build an environment where the students can freely ask their queries, confusions to anyone - teachers or students without being judged.
    I see Jugal House as a place where each student is strong in their own field, they are not obliged to be the best at everything, as a united Jugal would gain more.
    I envision Jugal as a place of comfort and care, where no one has to be ashamed of their weaknesses, but instead help each other with their strengths.
    I wish to shape the students of Jugal House in such a manner, where a student with a query can ask anyone and further teach and assist others with the same query.
    Being the academic coordinator, I aspire to mold the students' minds in such a way that they can understand topics quickly and not have to worry about their grades but be able to practice it in real life.

<div id="todo">
    <h5 style="color: rgb(219, 235, 0); font-family: 'Lucida Sans';">What I Plan To Do:</h5>
   <p> As the academic coordinater, I aim to make Jugal House an efficient house amongst the school.
    I plan to conduct tutoring sessions weekly for different grades as per the need of the students on any online platforms like Google Meet, Zoom,etc.
    I wish to build a mindset amongst the students in such a manner that they will not worry about their grades but learn to apply the knowledge they have earned in different fields.
    As we can see a huge influx in the mental health issues of teenagers, I intend to help the students with their emotional being.
    I want to motivate and inspire them to bring relief in their stress so they do not have any mental exhaustions.
    As the academic coordinator, I think it is important to balance the mental well-being and academic achievements of the students.
    I will be an approachable and patient person, so that the students can easily interact with me.
    As the online learning approach may not be as efficient, but I will advice and guide students as I can to maintain and further improve the quality of learning and grades of Jugal house.
    I am sure that a lot of students improve their grades and mindset through my guidance.
    I am resolute to take a further step and not just make "academic coordinater" a title to receive, but make it a responsibilty to improve the academics and mental well-being of the students.
